				<h1>Ejaz Ali&apos;s Page Editor</h1>
				<p>Navigation, global styles and home page</p>

				<div class="card">
					<h2>Home page</h2>
					<code>home.html</code>
					<p>
						The homepage is a page which is presented to the user
						after the splash screen. It is designed to be visually
						appealing and quickly explain the purpose of SeaGate as
						well as provide a call to action for the user to get
						involved.
					</p>
					<p>
						The current call to action is to volunteer labelled as
						"Help now", as we would rather point the user to
						volunteer rather than donate or give money.
					</p>
					<p>
						The homepage starts off showcasing a video of a man who
						is pulling a bucket out of the water, which is relevant
						to the goal of the charity.
					</p>
					<p>
						The video is contained in a
						<code>&lt;section&gt;</code> which has a primary purpose
						of dividing the rest of the content away from this page,
						and to help layer text on-top of the video to use the
						space extremely efficiently.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to layer the text on-top of the video, I opted
						to use the following CSS rule:
						<code>position: relative</code> on the section, and
						<code>position: absolute</code> on the video.
					</p>
					<p>
						How this works is that
						<code>position: relative</code> makes sure that children
						inside of it can only be positioned inside of it and not
						across the whole DOM, which makes it easier for me to
						position the text on-top of the video as the video
						stayed attached to the section at all times.
					</p>
					<p>
						This also means I don&apos;t need to disrupt the normal
						flow of the DOM by positioning elements that don&apos;t
						exist due to <code>position: absolute</code> or
						<code>position: fixed</code>.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>Just below it, the page content begins.</p>
					<p>
						I wanted something eye-catching and something simple, so
						I addded a beautiful rainbow that I built in a design
						tool called Figma and applied it as a
						<code>background-image</code> that stays at the top
						centre of the section, always.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some simple words explaining who we are and what we do,
						as well as three cards that explain our business model
						and our relation to the United Nations in steps.
					</p>
					<p>
						That ensures that visitors are aware of who we are, what
						we do, why we do it, and who we do it for - cruicial
						information to keep the user engaged.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inside each of the 3 cards, there is an image with an
						icon: an institution, a spanner and a heart - which
						shows how changes come from the UN and end up with world
						love being the end result of all of our actions.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is a beautiful shadow underneath all of the card
						to distinguish them and on mobile and lower resolution
						screens only one card is visible at a time, and you can
						scroll left and right where the scroll snaps to the
						start of the cards to avoid content not being visible at
						all.
					</p>

					<hr />

					<p>
						Below that I have the links to the content page in a
						creative way.
					</p>
					<p>
						I instructed my team members to create their content
						pages like news or blog articles to which I created a
						section named Reads From SeaGate which contains a grid
						of posts.
					</p>
					<p>
						The posts link to the content pages of each student in
						their respective order and the post previews contain the
						image and titles of the content pages.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						Throughout the whole home page, I made use of flexbox, a
						very cool CSS technology which allows me to make
						children of a particular element move around exactly how
						I want them to, all while staying responsive.
