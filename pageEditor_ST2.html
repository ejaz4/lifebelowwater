				<h1>Ejaz Ali&apos;s Page Editor</h1>
				<p>Navigation, global styles and home page</p>

				<div class="card">
					<h2>Home page</h2>
					<code>home.html</code>
					<p>
						The homepage is a page which is presented to the user
						after the splash screen. It is designed to be visually
						appealing and quickly explain the purpose of SeaGate as
						well as provide a call to action for the user to get
						involved.
					</p>
					<p>
						The current call to action is to volunteer labelled as
						"Help now", as we would rather point the user to
						volunteer rather than donate or give money.
					</p>
					<p>
						The homepage starts off showcasing a video of a man who
						is pulling a bucket out of the water, which is relevant
						to the goal of the charity.
					</p>
					<p>
						The video is contained in a
						<code>&lt;section&gt;</code> which has a primary purpose
						of dividing the rest of the content away from this page,
						and to help layer text on-top of the video to use the
						space extremely efficiently.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to layer the text on-top of the video, I opted
						to use the following CSS rule:
						<code>position: relative</code> on the section, and
						<code>position: absolute</code> on the video.
					</p>
					<p>
						How this works is that
						<code>position: relative</code> makes sure that children
						inside of it can only be positioned inside of it and not
						across the whole DOM, which makes it easier for me to
						position the text on-top of the video as the video
						stayed attached to the section at all times.
					</p>
					<p>
						This also means I don&apos;t need to disrupt the normal
						flow of the DOM by positioning elements that don&apos;t
						exist due to <code>position: absolute</code> or
						<code>position: fixed</code>.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>Just below it, the page content begins.</p>
					<p>
						I wanted something eye-catching and something simple, so
						I addded a beautiful rainbow that I built in a design
						tool called Figma and applied it as a
						<code>background-image</code> that stays at the top
						centre of the section, always.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some simple words explaining who we are and what we do,
						as well as three cards that explain our business model
						and our relation to the United Nations in steps.
					</p>
					<p>
						That ensures that visitors are aware of who we are, what
						we do, why we do it, and who we do it for - cruicial
						information to keep the user engaged.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inside each of the 3 cards, there is an image with an
						icon: an institution, a spanner and a heart - which
						shows how changes come from the UN and end up with world
						love being the end result of all of our actions.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is a beautiful shadow underneath all of the card
						to distinguish them and on mobile and lower resolution
						screens only one card is visible at a time, and you can
						scroll left and right where the scroll snaps to the
						start of the cards to avoid content not being visible at
						all.
					</p>

					<hr />

					<p>
						Below that I have the links to the content page in a
						creative way.
					</p>
					<p>
						I instructed my team members to create their content
						pages like news or blog articles to which I created a
						section named Reads From SeaGate which contains a grid
						of posts.
					</p>
					<p>
						The posts link to the content pages of each student in
						their respective order and the post previews contain the
						image and titles of the content pages.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						Throughout the whole home page, I made use of flexbox, a
						very cool CSS technology which allows me to make
						children of a particular element move around exactly how
						I want them to, all while staying responsive.

					<h2>Table page (Donate)</h2>
					<code>table.html</code>

					<p>This page is designed to encourage users to donate.</p>
					<p>
						It has been developed and designed to give users freedom
						and choice by showing and presenting flexible and free
						options for donating to the charity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Minimalism and simplistic design was at heart during the
						development of the Table page.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the table page, I have <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> set
						to be a flexbox, with all its children in the centre of
						the page, because I wanted a page with a table to be
						central on the screen, which meant the text should hover
						around the centre.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inside <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, I have
						<code>&lt;section&gt;</code> with a class I called
						<code>.readable</code>. The purpose of
						<code>.readable</code> is it is intended to optimise
						content inside of it to be as readable as possible by
						the user.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some optimisations include, small amount of
						breathability and the most important of all: a width of
						700 pixels, or approximately 30-50 characters per line.
					</p>
					<p>
						This means that readers won&apos;t need to move their
						head left or right while reading. On mobile, it will
						just extend to the full width of the page.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						I included a drawing that is an SVG of a ship sailing as
						a decorative illustrative that was provided from
						<a href="https://undraw.co">undraw</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Below, I wrote an explanation as to what the table is
						describing, and what the purpose of the table is.
					</p>
					<p>
						The purpose is to ease the user into the donation table
						without surprising them with a load of data.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hence, short paragraphs are used as they&apos;re lighter
						and easier to read.
					</p>

					<hr />

					<p>
						As for the actual table, I made use of
						<code>&lt;table&gt;</code> for the table,
						<code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> for the table rows,
						<code>&lt;td&gt;</code> for the table data, and
						<code>&lt;th&gt;</code> for the table headers.
					</p>
					<p>
						The table has all of its borders collapsed using
						<code>border-collapse: collapsed</code> so that all the
						borders combine and that the cells aren&apos;t avoiding
						each other.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to curve the table, I had to make use of a CSS
						selector called <code>:first-child</code> and
						<code>:last-child</code> to navigate myself to the top
						left and top right cells to apply
						<code>border-radius</code> to them.
					</p>
					<p>
						The table itself is a two-way table, with features and
						benefits on the Y axis and the donation amount on the X
						axis.
					</p>
					<p>
						The aim of the table is to show a reader what their
						donation would equate to and what they would receive in
						a donation if they were to donate a particular amount.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inside, if a price point supported a benefit, I used an
						SVG of a checkmark, provided by
						<a href="https://lucide.dev">lucide icons</a>. If there
						was a catch to the feature, a piece of text would show
						next to it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The table transitions upwards if you hover and the
						shadow concentrates on hover to show you a clearer
						border of where it starts and ends.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						To promote transparency, I listed all the available
						payment methods, including a method using cash.
					</p>
					<p>
						I felt it was appropriate to implement this using an
						unordered list as it is a list of items that has no
						particular order.
					</p>

					<h2>Content page</h2>
					<code>content_ST2.html</code>

					<p>
						This page was designed to mimick a news article of the
						charity unveiling products at an event.
					</p>

					<p>
						I used the same <code>.readable</code> CSS optimisation
						I used earlier in the donation page, but this time I
						wrapped the <code>.readable</code> section with a
						modified <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> which was mutated and
						adjusted to be a flexbox that was in the direction of a
						row using <code>flex-direction: row;</code> instead of a
						column like traditional HTML.
					</p>
					<p>
						The article is off to the left and the navigation is on
						the right side showing off the different areas that the
						user can jump to.
					</p>
					<p>
						The navigation is a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> that is
						<code>position: sticky</code> meaning it follows the
						browser so that the user can navigate at any point
						during their read to skip lesser interesting parts or
						get to parts that excite them the most.
					</p>

					<p>
						Seperated by a gap, there is a Get To Top button in the
						navigation that I believe is in the right place. It is a
						simple click in a place the user can find without taking
						up even more space for the user.
					</p>

					<p>
						On mobile, the navigation does not appear as both major
						mobile operating systems have methods of extracting text
						off the screen, and both major operating systems have
						the ability to jump to the top.
					</p>

					<hr />

					<p>
						The headings are in order from h1 to h6 and the images
						have been labelled using alt text that are extremely
						descriptive.
					</p>

					<p>
						The site adapts and responds very well to mobile and all
						major web browsers can successfully identify and
						activate their reader modes on the content page.

					<h2>Header</h2>

					<p>The header is a vital part of the website.</p>
					<p>
						It is shown on-top of everything and stays there forever
						so that the user can quickly navigate to different areas
						of the website.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you visit a page that is accessible through the
						navigation, that page is highlighted in the navigation
						with a white highlight to indicate you&apos;re on that
						page to the user.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you hover, a dark highlight shows to indicate
						you&apos;re able to click it.
					</p>

					<p>
						When you scroll down on any page with the header, the
						header will collapse and become transparent to show more
						content. The colours of the header drown out to not
						distract the user as much and the logo becomes smaller.
					</p>
					<p>
						On mobile, the navigation on the header is no longer
						shown and will show a hamburger menu instead, which when
						toggled, will show the same contents as the desktop
						navigation but in a stacked layout.
					</p>

					<p>Click the logo at any time to return to the homepage.</p>

				<div class="card">
					<h2>Footer</h2>

					<p>The footer is displayed at the bottom of every page.</p>
					<p>
						It displays vital links to content, validation and page
						editors from other students.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is a two sided design with a nice logo and a
						copyright year on the left side, and on the right side
						all the links in beautiful font.
