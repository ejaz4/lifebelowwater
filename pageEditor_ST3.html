                <h2 id="feedback">Feedback Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The feedback page features a large form that users can give information to and submit to the website. It uses the input tags to create fields for users to give information to. It also uses input type = to determine what kind of input should be given to the form, for example fields such as name use input type = "name" whereas others such as phone number use input type = "tel". This is to ensure that users can only submit desired information in the given fields.</p> 
                        <p>The fields each use setCustomValidity to allow for custom error messages to better inform the user of what they need to do when they haven't provided valid information such as telling the user to insert their full name or give a valid zip code. Certain fields are given the required attribute to make sure that the user cannot submit the form without filling out specific fields that are needed. To better inform the user of what information is needed in each field the label tag is used to provide a description of the input field to tell the user what information to give.</p>
                        <p>The form features drop down menus and select menus with preselected options for users to choose from as well as a file select button giving them the ability to submit a .png .jpg or .jpeg file</p>
                        <p>Buttons such as submit have the css attribute cursor:pointer to make it so when hovered the cursor will change. Input fields are given criteria such as input:valid and input:invalid to change the field based on whether the given input is valid or not to help users fill out the form.</p>
                        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Required fields are marked with an * to inform the users of what fields need to be filled out. Invalid fields are coloured red and change to green upon giving a valid input. Fields such as zip code have formatting to ensure users can only provide a valid zip code to the field. All fields are given an input type to control what users can submit as well as their name allowing for cached information to be autofilled and submitted from users' browsers. Each question is laid out separately to allow for easier user experience</p>
