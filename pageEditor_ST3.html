					<h2 id="feedback">Feedback Page</h2>
					<h3>Technical Description</h3>
					<p>
						The feedback page features a large form that users can
						give information to and submit to the website. It uses
						the input tags to create fields for users to give
						information to. It also uses input type = to determine
						what kind of input should be given to the form, for
						example fields such as name use input type = "name"
						whereas others such as phone number use input type =
						"tel". This is to ensure that users can only submit
						desired information in the given fields.
					</p>
					<p>
						The fields each use setCustomValidity to allow for
						custom error messages to better inform the user of what
						they need to do when they haven't provided valid
						information such as telling the user to insert their
						full name or give a valid zip code. Certain fields are
						given the required attribute to make sure that the user
						cannot submit the form without filling out specific
						fields that are needed. To better inform the user of
						what information is needed in each field the label tag
						is used to provide a description of the input field to
						tell the user what information to give.
					</p>
					<p>
						The form features drop down menus and select menus with
						preselected options for users to choose from as well as
						a file select button giving them the ability to submit a
						.png .jpg or .jpeg file
					</p>
					<p>
						Buttons such as submit have the css attribute
						cursor:pointer to make it so when hovered the cursor
						will change. Input fields are given criteria such as
						input:valid and input:invalid to change the field based
						on whether the given input is valid or not to help users
						fill out the form.
					</p>
					<h3>Accessibility</h3>
					<p>
						Required fields are marked with an * to inform the users
						of what fields need to be filled out. Invalid fields are
						coloured red and change to green upon giving a valid
						input. Fields such as zip code have formatting to ensure
						users can only provide a valid zip code to the field.
						All fields are given an input type to control what users
						can submit as well as their name allowing for cached
						information to be autofilled and submitted from users'
						browsers. Each question is laid out separately to allow
						for easier user experience

					<h2 id="team">Team Page</h2>
					<h3>Technical Description</h3>
					<p>
						The team page uses img tags to show images of everyone
						on the team as well as heading tags to show their name
						and p tags to give a brief description of the
						highlighted member. Div tags are used to organise the
						website into sections so specific aspects can be managed
						at a time. Tabindex is used so that the images can be
						accessed by hovering over images but also by using the
						tab key.
					</p>
					<p>
						Majority of the team page is made using CSS rather than
						html. Images are given the transition attribute to
						control aspects such as their opacity and size so it can
						be changed later when hovering over the images allowing
						me to control the rate at which it changes rather than
						it being immediate. When hovering over an image, the
						image is enlarged and given a border to highlight it as
						well as changing its opacity to make it clear which
						member you are looking at. The div class for the
						description also changes from being invisible to being
						visible on hover to give more information about the
						selected member
					</p>
					<p>
						Margin properties are used to ensure that when the
						images are enlarged no formatting issues occur and keeps
						the website functional.
					</p>
					<h3>Accessibility</h3>
					<p>
						By highlighting images via means such as borders and
						enlarging images it makes the website easier to use as
						users can easily tell which user they are currently
						looking at. Furthermore, by using tabindex more people
						are able to use the website regardless of hardware
						requirements.

				<section>
					<h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
					<h3>Technical Description</h3>
					<p>
						The content page is divided into sections to allow for
						each to be given an id to use in navigation. The page
						features an aside section to create a sidebar with a
						fixed position so it will always be visible to users
						screens and allow them to navigate through the website
						with ease. The website also features a button with a
						fixed button that when clicked allows for the users to
						go back to the top of the website at any time. Each
						section is given a header to inform users of what each
						section is about while being given a paragraph of
						information with an image to accompany the header.
						Unordered lists are used to make lists such as targets
						and aims for better formatting and make it easier for
						the user to see by making each bullet point bold.
					</p>
					<p>
						Images are displayed in block with an auto margin to
						allow for them to be in the center of the page. The
						aside section is given the text-decoration:none
						attribute so that even when clicking the sidebar it will
						appear the same and appear much better than changing
						colour since the sidebar is intended to be frequently
						used.
					</p>

					<h3>Accessibility</h3>
					<p>
						The navigation sidebar is intended to help users
						navigate through the website and allow them to
						immediately go to the section they want to. The "back to
						top" button servers the same purpose where it allows
						users to return to the beginning of the webpage whenever
						they want to improve user experience and make navigation
						easier.

					<h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
					<p>
						Challenges faced during the implementation process
						include how during the making of the feedback page I had
						to learn certain attribute tags to customise the form
						how I wanted to. For example, having to learn
						setCustomValidity to allow for custom error messages to
						better inform the user or learning how to format the
						postcode by customising the text input in the field. One
						of the biggest challenges came with the star system as
						html has no way to acknowledge successive elements so
						initially I had no clue how to make the star system.
						Upon doing some research I found out html can identify
						previous elements using the :before element and you are
						able to reverse elements using the direction attribute.
						By using these 2 attributes I was able to reverse the
						star order so instead of going 1 2 3 4 5 it goes 5 4 3 2
						1 and works as a functioning star rating system when
						hovered over.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the team page, initially aligning the images how I
						wanted them to be was a challenge but via using the
						margin and display properties correct I was able to
						arrange them in a way I was happy with. At the start I
						wasn't familiar with how to make the text appear on
						hover so I had to learn how to use the visibility
						attribute and hover attribute to get the desired effects
						when making the page. Lastly, I had no idea how to make
						the images change properties in a appealing fashion
						rather than just having them change immedidately, so
						afterwards I found the transition property and found
						that you could assign certain attributes that would
						change according to an assigned timeframe e.g 0.5s which
						allowed me to do much more visually appealing changes to
						the images when hovered over.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the content page the biggest challenge faced was
						making the navigation bar. I knew how to use href and
						ids to make navigation throughout the site but creating
						the sidebar with the correct formatting proved to be
						difficult. I looked online for other people who had made
						sidebars and saw the css they used to format it then was
						able to take that and create my own sidebar which was
						fully functional and allowed for navigation throughout
						the site.

					<h2 id="compliance">Compliance</h2>
					<p>
						All the webpages created contain no offensive material
						and images of people are used with given consent. No
						illegal access to services is granted nor facilities. No
						advertisements of any kind are present on the site. Most
						videos are from free stock footage sites however some
						images may cause copyright infringement due to being
						pulled from the internet.
