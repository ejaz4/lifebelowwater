        <p>The world‚Äôs oceans are often referred to as the very life-blood of the Earth as these seas regulate the climate, conserve diversity of life, and provide food and livelihoods for billions of people. However, through our doing, we place them amid shrinking risks. Here, we set the stage for the oceans significance, the sorts of threats they are facing, and how we can act to protect them.</p>
