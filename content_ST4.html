        <p>The world’s oceans are often referred to as the very life-blood of the Earth as these seas regulate the climate, conserve diversity of life, and provide food and livelihoods for billions of people. However, through our doing, we place them amid shrinking risks. Here, we set the stage for the oceans significance, the sorts of threats they are facing, and how we can act to protect them.</p>

            <h2>🌏 Importance of Oceans</h2>
            <img src="./images/1.png" alt="Vast ocean view">
            <p>Oceans cover over 70% of the Earth's surface and hold 97% of the planet's water. They produce at least 50% of the world’s oxygen and absorb 30% of human-generated CO₂, acting as Earth’s natural climate regulator.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                “The ocean is the keystone of the Earth's life support system.”
            </div>
            <p>In addition to their ecological functions, oceans sustain a $2.5 trillion international economy annually, encompassing the shipping, tourism, and fishing industries.</p>

            <h2>⚠️ Challenges Facing Marine Environments</h2>
            <img src="./images/2.png" alt="Plastic debris on a beach">
            <h3>Plastic Pollution</h3>
            <p>Over 17 million metric tons of plastic trash enter the ocean annually, posing a threat to marine life as well as contaminating the food supply. The figure is projected to triple by the year 2040 if no actions are taken.</p>
            <h3>Climate Change & Ocean Acidification</h3>
            <p>Ocean acidity has increased by 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, which complicates the ability of coral reefs and shellfish to survive. Rising sea temperatures also cause coral bleaching and loss of marine habitat.</p>
            <h3>Overfishing & Habitat Destruction</h3>
            <p>34% of the global stocks of fish are overexploited. Illegal fishing and destructive methods like bottom trawling are wiping out entire ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>🌍 Global Initiatives to Protect Oceans</h2>
            <img src="./images/3.png" alt="Map of Marine Protected Areas">
            <p>Governments and organizations worldwide are working together to safeguard marine biodiversity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs):</b> Over 16% of marine waters are conserved in order to prevent overfishing and habitat destruction.</li>
                <li><b>Plastic Waste Reduction:</b> The UK, Canada, and Kenya have outlawed single-use plastics.</li>
