					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>SeaGate works to achieve the united nations aim of conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.</p>
					<p>Oceans and seas cover over 70% of our planet and we require them for necessary things such as food, energy and water. Despite our obvious need for these things we have done immense damage to these resources. Issues such as pollution and overfishing are massive issues even today and are a large cause for the damage to our waters. We need to protect them by eliminating pollution and managing marine life around the world to ensure our waters remain safe</p>

					<h2>Targets and Aims</h2>
					<p>SeaGate works with United Nations to achieve the ten targets to achieve sustainability in the ocean</p>
					<hr>
					<!-- Points list -->
					<ul>
						<li class="points">Reduce Marine Pollution</li>
						<li>Reduce pollution of all kinds by 2025 primarily from land-based activities such as marine debris and nutrient pollution</li>
						<li class="points">Protect and Restore Ecosystems</li>
						<li>By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts</li>
						<li class="points">Reduce Ocean Acidification</li>
						<li>Minimise and address the impacts of ocean acidification through enhanced scientific cooperation</li>
						<li class="points">Sustainable Fishing</li>
						<li>Regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices</li>
						<li class="points">Conserve Coastal and Marine Areas</li>
						<li>By 2020 conserver at least 10% of coastal and marine areas</li>
						<li class="points">End Subsidies Contributing to Overfishing</li>
						<li>By 2020 prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing</li>
						<li class="points">Increase the Economic Benefits from Sustainable Use of Marine Resources</li>
						<li>By 2030 increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries via the sustainable use of marine resources</li>
						<li class="points">Increase Scientific Knowledge, Research and Technology for Ocean Health</li>
						<li>Use scientific knowledge and develop research capacity to improve ocean health</li>
						<li class="points">Support Small Scale Fishers</li>
						<li>Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets</li>
						<li class="points">Implement and Enforce International Sea Law</li>
						<li>Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law </li>
					</ul>

					<h2>The Problems and Concerns</h2>
					<p>If ocean pollution is not dealt with in the near future we will be facing many consequences that both directly and indirectly affect marine life, as well as humans</p>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li class="points">Harmful to marine life</li>
						<li>Oil spills will ensnare and suffocate marine animals by permeating their gills. Oil can cause seabird feathers, they may not be able to fly or feed their young. Animals may also begin to suffer from cancer</li>
						<li>Marine animals also mistake small plastic debris for food or become entangled in or strangled by plastic bags and discarded fishing nets. Animals most vulnerable to harm from plastic debris in the ocean include dolphins, fish, sharks and whales</li>
						<li class="points">Depletion of oxygen in seawater</li>
						<li>As excess debris in the ocean slowly degrades over many years, it uses oxygen to do so, resulting in less oxygen in the ocean. Low levels of oxygen in the ocena lead to the death of ocean animals such as penguins, dolphins, whales and sharks</li>
						<li class="points">Threat to Human Health</li>
						<li>Pollutants in the ocean make their way back to humans. Small organisms ingest toxins and are eaten by larger predators, many of which are seafood that we eventually eat. When the toxins in contaminated animals get deposited in human tissue, it can lead to long-term health conditions, cancer and birth defects.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>There are many ways the average person can do in their daily lives to help prevent pollution in the ocean and save marine life</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use nontoxic chemicals and dispose of chemicals properly</li>
						<li>Reduce waste and cut down on what you throw away</li>
						<li>Use fuel efficient vehicles or use substitutes such as bikes</li>
						<li>Treat the environment with care to avoid damage to it</li>
						<li>Buy less plastic and use a reusable bag</li>
