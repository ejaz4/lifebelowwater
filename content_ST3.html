				<section id="section1">
					<p>SeaGate works to achieve the united nations aim of conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.</p>
					<p>Oceans and seas cover over 70% of our planet and we require them for necessary things such as food, energy and water. Despite our obvious need for these things we have done immense damage to these resources. Issues such as pollution and overfishing are massive issues even today and are a large cause for the damage to our waters. We need to protect them by eliminating pollution and managing marine life around the world to ensure our waters remain safe</p>
