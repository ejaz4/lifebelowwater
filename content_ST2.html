					<em>SeaGate Research Lab, University of Westminster</em> ‐
					SeaGate hosts an annual conference called SGC, aimed for
					millions of marine enthusiasts and scientific researchers,
					to present new research, information and guidance on how the
					year should be approached as well as what improvements can
					be made based on data collected from the previous year.
				</p>

				<h2 id="deployment">Deployment of TempGate</h2>
				<p>
					SeaGate announces creation of a network of 360 new
					submersibles, called TempGate, manafactured and built by
					SeaGate.
				</p>
				<p>
					TempGate is SeaGate&apos;s first submersible that was
					designed, engineered and built by SeaGate in London.
					It&apos;s built to widthstand the harsh conditions of the
					ocean and to be able to collect data from the ocean floor
					and the water column.
				</p>
				<p>
					TempGate is designed to collect data such as temperature,
					humidity, salinity, pH and seismic activity of the water.
					The submersible is also equipped with a camera to capture
					images of the ocean floor and the water column. Data
					captured from submersible will be used to monitor and
					research vital and all areas of the ocean as TempGate will
					patrol the seas aiming to have 45% coverage by 2025.
				</p>
				<h3 id="sponsorship">
					New SeaGate Submersible Sponsored By Bloom Within
				</h3>
				<p>
					Bloom Within has sponsored the manufacture and production of
					1000 TempGate submersibles in a £2.4m deal with SeaGate
					until 2035.
				</p>
				<p>
					In response, all Bloom Within sponsored submersible will be
					painted with Bloom Within and SeaGate branding.
				</p>

				<h2 id="stateofwater">SeaGate Announces State of Water 2025</h2>
				<img
					src="images/stateofwater.png"
					alt="State of Water 2025 is 7.6, toxic."
				/>
				<p>
					State of Water is measured on a scale from 1 (low-risk) to
					10 (extreme toxicity).
				</p>
				<p>
					At the conference, SeaGate also released its annual State of
					Water report, which highlighted the ongoing challenges faced
					by the world’s oceans. According to the report, the State of
					Water 2025 is rated at 7.6, categorized as toxic, which
					reflects a growing global concern over marine pollution,
					rising temperatures, and declining biodiversity. The report
					emphasized that the oceans are facing increasing threats
					from human activities such as industrial waste, overfishing,
					and plastic pollution, as well as the ongoing impacts of
					climate change.
				</p>
				<p>
					The State of Water scale, ranging from 1 (low-risk) to 10
					(extreme toxicity), has become a vital indicator of ocean
					health and serves as a benchmark for policymakers,
					scientists, and environmental advocates to assess and track
					the condition of the oceans over time. The alarming toxicity
					rating underscores the urgent need for global collaboration
					and innovative solutions to address the growing crises
					affecting marine environments.
